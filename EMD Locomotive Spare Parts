For 20+ years, ASA Engine Equipments has supplied EMD Locomotive Spare Parts to railway operators across the world. We specialize in OEM-grade and high-strength aftermarket components for EMD 567, EMD 645, and EMD 710 engines, the backbone of freight and passenger locomotives globally.

EMD (Electro-Motive Diesel) engines are known for reliability, efficiency, and unmatched performance in heavy-duty operations. This blog provides a complete breakdown of key spare parts, specifications, installation tips, maintenance guidelines, troubleshooting advice and international supply coverage.

EMD Locomotive Engine Models We Cover
✔ EMD 567 Series

One of the most famous two-stroke engines used worldwide. Known for rugged design and long-term reliability.

✔ EMD 645 Series

Enhanced version with better airflow, improved power output, and higher combustion efficiency.

✔ EMD 710 Series

A modern, high-horsepower engine used in demanding freight applications. Offers lower emissions and superior fuel economy.

Key EMD Locomotive Spare Parts
EMD Power Assemblies
EMD power assemblies include the liner, piston, piston rings, connecting rod, and wrist pin. These assemblies are pre-balanced and designed for quick replacement. Our power assemblies provide stable performance under extremely high loads.

Explained

Power assemblies directly impact combustion performance and fuel efficiency. High-quality assemblies ensure stable compression, reduced wear, and minimized downtime. Using precision-machined components ensures long operational life and reliable engine behavior, even under extreme conditions.

EMD Pistons & Piston Rings
Manufactured from high-grade forged steel, these pistons can handle high temperatures and crosshead loads. Our piston rings provide perfect sealing and compression.

Detailed lines:
The piston moves thousands of times per minute, so durability is critical. High-density steel prevents cracking, deformation, and heat fatigue. Precise ring gaps ensure correct sealing, improving combustion and lowering oil consumption.

EMD Engine Liners
Our hardened steel liners maintain accurate cylinder geometry over long periods. They resist wear, corrosion, and temperature fluctuations.

Explained:

The liner must withstand constant friction and high piston speed. High-quality liners reduce internal wear, preventing scoring and blow-by. This increases engine life and enhances combustion consistency across cylinders.

EMD Turbocharger Parts
We supply rotor assemblies, blower wheels, diffusers, and bearing kits for EMD turbochargers compatible with 645 & 710 models.

Explained:

Turbochargers deliver pressurized air into the engine, increasing power output. Quality turbo components maintain stable airflow and prevent vibration and imbalance. This improves overall engine performance and reduces fuel consumption.

EMD Crankshaft & Bearings
Precision-balanced crankshafts and high-strength bearing sets maintain perfect rotational motion and load handling.

Explained:

Crankshafts transfer piston movement into rotational force. Even small imbalances can damage the engine. High-quality bearings reduce friction, maintain smooth movement, and prevent premature failures.

Installation & Maintenance Tips
✔ Power Assemblies

Ensure the liner seat is clean, measure bore size, and torque fasteners as per EMD manual.

✔ Pistons & Rings

Check ring end gaps and apply lubrication before installation.

✔ Turbochargers

Always inspect shaft play and oil supply lines to prevent overheating.

✔ Bearings

Monitor temperature and vibration to detect early wear.
